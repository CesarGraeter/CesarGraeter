### My portfolio 

<!--
**CesarGraeter/CesarGraeter** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning models
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ways to score models
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with TensorFlow
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about business intelligence

- ðŸ”­ Case I

The goal here is to show you the full solution to a prediction issue, since raw data to a web application, not to design the best machine learning model.

The case is based on a dataset from Kaggle, that we supose to predict the number of bike rentals per day.

The strategie was to:
  - import the data set to a python notebook and explore it using pandas,
  - a little work to find best features and estimators,
  - tune the chosen model and
  - deploy a web app that uses the model in the internet

Now, let me show you how do i did. The link below will send you to the python code that make the model happend. Don't worry if you never wrote a code yet, it's very well remarked, don't be shy to click.

Now you know how to create models with pycaret, check out the code i wrote to deploy on Streamlit the web app:

If you still reading it's because you like it, right ? :) The link below, will send you to the web app, here is fun since you understand we did before, now it's time to "predict", try yourself, change parameters and check how it affects:
