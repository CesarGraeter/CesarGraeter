Case I
The goal here is to show you i'm able to work as a full stack Data Scientist.
The case is based on a dataset from Kaggle, that we supose to predict number of bike rentals per day.
The strategie was to:
  - import to a python notebook and explore the data set using pandas,
  - let pycaret show us the best features and estimators,
  - tune the chosen model and
  - deploy a web app that uses the model in the internet

The link below will send you to the code that make the model happend, don't worry if you don't code yet, it's very well remarked, don't be shy to click.

That link below, will send you to the web app, here is fun, since you understand we did before, now it's time to "predict", try yourself:
